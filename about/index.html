<p>Hi, I’m Andres Clari founder of SteelCode Consulting.</p>

<p>I’m a mobile and web developer.</p>

<img class="about-img" src="/img/Me.jpg"/>

<p>I’ve been programming since ’95, invested a lot of time in desktop applications, and artificial intelligence related research. In 2005 I worked as a graphical designer, where I learned the power and the difference a well thought user interface can have and also how important it is to code them properly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Currently I specialize in mobile development for the Android platform, with both native, and cross platform HTML5 solutions, web development for web applications, front-end and backend development using top of the line technologies such as Ruby on Rails with HTML5 / CSS3, JavaScript and PHP while writing clean and SEO efficient code. And we also do WordPress theme customizations and I offer mobile development and design services for the Android platform, both native and web based.</p>

<p>My personal projects include several Android apps, Windows Phone apps, and few web applications (you’ll know about them soon), although my professional work keeps my days pretty busy.</p>

<p>I’m also enrolled in several learn on distance programs from universities such as Stanford and Berkeley, as I like to keep improving in both my professional field and others such as medicine.</p>
