<p>
    If you're interested in hiring me for your next great project, want me to 
    speak at an event, or just want to say hi, just drop me an email, and we can
    chat about it.
</p>

<p>
    Before we begin, you should know that my minimum rate for building a
    website starts at $300 depending on the work, although I work based on clear
    estimates, always meeting my clients needs.
</p>

<p>
    My current rates for mobile application projects start at $500 depending as
    well on the project complexity and requirements.
</p>

<p>
    If you want me to speak at your event, right now I'm only doing local events
    based on Spain, and particularly the Valencia region. However if you would 
    like me to attend at another location we can work something out provided my
    expenses are covered.
</p>

<p>
    With that out of the way, I'd love to hear from you.
