Created native Android app for Metrovalencia with bookmarks, maps, etc.

![Worklist](/img/portfolio/{{ page.title | remove: ' ' }}.jpg)
  
**What I did:** 

- Reverse engineered Metrovalencia's API to gain access to the timetables data.
- Implemented Android app.
- Created a cached bookmark system that allows you to have your most frequent
  destinations at your fingertips, even if network access is bad.
- Added Metrovalencia's grid map, in a custom view where the user can interact
  with it, zooming, panning, etc.
- Custom search view where you can make custom queries using all the data
  entries supported by the API.
- Implemented in app advertising via AdMob.
