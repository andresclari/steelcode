Created application basic image editor in C++ with the Qt framework, to enable
clients to perform simple image adjustments like cropping, brightness and
contrast, rotation, etc.

**What I did:** 

- Implemented C++ Qt application.
- Used OpenCV to provide some extras like image autoenhancing, reusing code from
  a previous project.
- Implemented cropping UI, since there was no previously available control for
  it.
