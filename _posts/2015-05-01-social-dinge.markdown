Created social network aggregation application for Android, using Kotlin, 
reactive extensions, Java, Google ads, and json API from server.

**What I did:** 

- Implemented application design using Android guidelines and modern features
  such as navigation drawer / menu, used Kotlin language and Reactive extensions
  to simplify development process, and make a very responsive UI.
- Used Google Admob to implement advertising.
- Used Json to retrieve custom data from remote server.
- Used powerful and well tested libraries to implement networking requests with
  caching for data and images.
- Optimized multi-threading to maximize responsiveness and performance.
