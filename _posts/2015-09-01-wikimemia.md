Created meme sharing and browsing application for Android, using Kotlin,
reactive extensions, Google ads, and custom json API connected to Wordpress blog
for authentication and post retrieval, publish and voting.

**What I did:** 

- Implemented application design using Android guidelines and modern features
  such as navigation drawer / menu, used Kotlin language and Reactive extensions
  to simplify development process, and make a very responsive UI.
- Used Google Admob to implement advertising.
- Using the Json API plugin for Wordpress, and heavily altering it to suite the
  needs of the project, used it to implement the required functionality of the
  application.
- Used Reactive extensions to deliver event based network calls to retrieve and
  process remote data.
- Used powerful and well tested libraries to implement networking requests with
  caching for data and images.
- Optimized multi-threading to maximize responsiveness and performance.
