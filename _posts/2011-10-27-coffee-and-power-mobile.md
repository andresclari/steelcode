Creation and implementation of mobile site with jQuery Mobile

![Worklist](/img/portfolio/{{ page.title | remove: ' ' }}.jpg)
  
**What I did:** 

- Implemented several parts of the site.
- Implemented a automatized system to populate views directly from the database.
- Implemented code to dynamically convert jQuery Mobile's urls with "hash" to
  Google's SEO required urls with "hashbang", all while supporting action hints
  on the url to make the site behave like an app and accept intents.
- Implemented Google Maps embedded in mobile views, with marked data from the
  server.
