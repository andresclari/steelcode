Created social networking application for Android, with Rails application as
backend.

![Plyze](/img/portfolio/{{ page.title | remove: ' ' }}.jpg)
  
**What I did:** 

- Implemented application design using Android guidelines and modern features
  such as navigation drawer / menu, card layout for main views, rounded user
  pictures, etc.
- Used powerful and well tested libraries to implement networking requests with
  caching for data and images.
- Highly threaded to maximize responsiveness and performance.
