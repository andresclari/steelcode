**What I did:** 

- Implementation from scratch of in-house PHP framework
- Implemented main view as a Google Map to track user activity using marker
  clusters, customized popups, and dynamic refresh of data with real time
  connections.
- Real time communications based on NodeJS and Socket.IO, to implement
  notifications, chat, payment notifications, and location changes.
- Created a SEO micro framework to generate dynamic SEO content for every user
  and every relevant view.
