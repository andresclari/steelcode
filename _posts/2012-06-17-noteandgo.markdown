Creation of Android app, NoteAndGo client for Simplenote

![Worklist](/img/portfolio/{{ page.title | remove: ' ' }}.jpg)
  
**What I did:** 

- Created Android app.
- Backwards compatible with Android 2.2 from Android 4.x+.
- Implemented ActionBar UI with support for versions pre 4.0.
- Created integration library to manage Simplenote's sync services.
- Implemented fast photo capture, that auto assigns the file name based on the
  current date so the user can go in and out in 2 taps.
- Use a gridview gallery to present captured photos.
- Implemented caching system to keep picture views performant.
- Built the UI with fragments design so it works on tablets.
