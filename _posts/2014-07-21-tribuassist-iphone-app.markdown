Created application for online tribute media management that allows uploading
photos and videos to create a DVD Tribute, the application allows editing of
pictures, and automatic extraction of various pictures taking one photo with
your phone.

**What I did:** 

- Implemented iOS application using best practices for user experience.
- Created a custom module using OpenCV and C++ to detect images within an image
  and extract those.
- Coded in C++ editing routines for auto enhancing images, rotation, and
  brightness and contrast editing.
- Used powerful and well tested libraries to implement networking requests with
  caching for data and images, and handling uploads to the server.
- Login mechanism to enable only authorized persons to manage tribute media.
