Created Rails web application to track highlights while streaming on Twich or
other services. Uses Twitter login for user management and stores your streaming
sessions and the highlights you made, letting you know at which point on the
video they happened.

**What I did:** 

- Used Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend.
- Dynamic web interface with jQuery, so that no reloads are required.
- Used OAuth with Twitter to provide integrated login.
- Hosted on the public cloud on Heroku.
